Demo of full stack communication

To test this follow these steps:
* run `npm i` to install dependencies
* run `npm start` to run the code
* Try open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000

Notice the way the request is sent from static/index.js, and handled by server's index.js,
no imports or anything just communication over the route

Also this is far from the only way of doing this, an easier way would be to use axios which
you can check out if you're interested

Feel free to ask any questions if you have
